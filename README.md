# TV Show Renamer

An application to rename in bulk TV show files and uses the TMDB API to match to a TV Show to give a nice formatting as an output ('<Show-name> - S<season-number>E<episode-number> - <episode-name>.<extension>').
This project was used as a way to discover new languages, so here you can find multiple implmentations under different directories.
